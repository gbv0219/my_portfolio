           <h2>Something other than that </h2>
        <p> In our first week as UX / UI designers we were assigned a project where we started by gathering insights and working out initial concepts.This allowed us to understand the users,
				  identify the scope of the project and prepare the design assets for development. Also known as a Design Sprint, it was an intensive week of absorbing as much as possible and coming
					 up with a solution for the client.
				  </p>
         <p>
					 The company
		Bloom Box (founded in 2016) is a young company that is looking to disrupt the online flower-gifts market by offering a customizable, one-of-a-kind product that focuses on the message, rather than the medium. The company’s mission is to keep the customer at the center of the experience by creating flower-gifts as unique as the reason for gifting them.
		With industry giants like 1-800 flowers, FTD, and Teleflora dominating online search results (and therefore online sales) customers find themselves in front of a website displaying hundreds of pre-designed arrangements arbitrarily clustered into categories like “Birthday, Get Well, Thank You, etc”. What makes a flower arrangement ideal for the “Thank You” category or the “Get Well” category is mostly a mystery, and browsing for the perfect arrangement becomes an overwhelming experience.
		Instead of offering a huge variety of arrangements to choose from, Bloom Box has one product that comes in 3 different sizes. The box is then customized to display a personal message and customers can put in special requests for the types of flowers and color palette that will come in the arrangement.
		By shifting the focus from amount of arrangements to choose from, to customization with flower choice and personal messages, Bloom Box is able to reduce inventory costs, stay lean, create a consistent product, and simplify the flower-buying experience.

          <h1> The Challenge </h1>
     <p>
			 But despite good results from their marketing and branding efforts to drive traffic to the site, the client is seeing a large drop-off rate once the users get to the product page and try to customize their Bloom Box.
	 The client would like to improve the online shopping experience in order to increase their conversion rate (ratio of people that visit the site vs. people who actually place an order). They want the shopping experience to be as simple, fresh, and fun as their flower boxes are.

         <h1> Our Approach </h1>

<p>
	We decided to conduct Design Sprint to start the project. We wanted to propose fast a concept that we could test and validate.
The Design Sprint is an intensive one-week problem-solving process through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers.It have been used by Google Ventures in companies like Airbnb, and Facebook.
The whole point of Design Sprint is to examine the problem and emerge with verifiable solutions quickly.
We started a meeting that turned into quick drawing sessions and before we knew we were busy sketching your ideas.
</p>

<div class="row monday">
<h2>Monday</h2>


<div id="image11">
<b style="font-size:24px"> Map showing how customers interact with the product.</b><br>
<img src="assets/images/bloom_box/image11.jpg">
</div>
<h2>The Research</h2>

<div class="col-md-6">

</div>
</div>

<p>
In order to obtain user data, interviews and surveys were conducted.
Through 2 different surveys, we asked both current users and potential users to answer key questions about the flower-buying process and their experience with the Bloom Box website.
We also interviewed potential users to uncover current pain points and behaviors around the flower-buying process to gather data for our design solutions.
From this research we were able to list the customer pain points:
Price of flowers
Expensive delivery
Quality assurance
Lack of information: description, customer reviews
Overwhelming check out process
</p>

<h2 style="color:grey; margin:60px 0">“How Might We” Statement </h2>

<p>In order to reframe problems we obtained through previous analysis as opportunities, we used “How Might We” statements. We voted for the statements that should be prioritized by dot voting.</p>
<div class="row monday">
	<div class="col-md-6">

</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<img id="image9" src="assets/images/bloom_box/image9.jpg">
</div>
<p>When the voting was over, we took the “How Might We” statements with multiple votes and choose two target events on the map to focus on.</p>
</div>

<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<p>
We examined the best examples of online-store implementations from other companies .  We got inspiration and drew components from online stores.We discussed them by presenting potential ideas in order to find the best solutions.

<p>
	Flowers online?! Please tell us why...
In order to  focus in the customer’s experience rather than the minute details of a screen, we drew a three-panel storyboard solution of the process showing what the customers will see as they interact with the service. (Borrar dots)
By the end of the day we had defining key words for the experience, dozens of marked examples and  rough sketches from our Crazy Eights sketch session.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Wednesday</h2>

<div class="row wednesday">
	<div class="col-md-6"style="text-align:center">
	<img src="assets/images/bloom_box/image4.jpg">
</div>
<div class="col-md-6"style="text-align:center">
<img src="assets/images/bloom_box/image10.jpg">
</div>
</div>


	<p>Our day started with a round stickers to vote on the solutions that stood out the most of our three-panel storyboard.
	Voting helped  guide the process and decide which solution will be prototyped.
After this process , I was in charge of creating a Storyboard,focusing  on the user flows in a narrative sequence of the website events.With this we were able to plan for the prototype.
</p>


<h2>Thursday</h2>

<p>After picking a solution from our  three-panel sketches and storyboarding a plan, I was ready to create a prototype.</p>

<img src="assets/images/bloom_box/image8.jpg">
<p>
As a team we implemented any updates necessary to the prototype and gathered things that should be consistent across the prototype like fonts,colors,layout,logo size and position.
A testing guide was created to guide us through the prototype interview session process for the day after.
</p>
 <h2>Friday</h2>
<p>
With a finished prototype that linked all screens, we were finally able to test and validate our idea with users
A member of our team interviewed five customers while I was watching them react to our prototype and taking notes
 of what was said by the tester in a whiteboard.
</p>

<img src="assets/images/bloom_box/image7.jpg">
<p>

The interviews went well with positive feedback.We discussed patterns and the sprint was concluded by choosing to move forward with the successful components of the prototype.
This is what a great design team is all about - working together to build something that matters to real people!
